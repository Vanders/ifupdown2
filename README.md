Usage
-----
### Recipes
-----
#### ifupdown2::default

Provides a Chef service resource for the networking service, and configures the system for network interfaces configuration fragments.

By default the recipe creates the fragments directory specifed in `node['ifupdown2']['interfaces']['dir']` attribute, then uses `ifquery` to extract the current configuration for the `eth0` and `lo` interfaces. The current `/etc/network/interfaces` file is then over-written with one that uses configuration fragments.

This recipe is intended to be used with the `cumulus_interfaces_policy` and `cumulus_interface`, `cumulus_bridge` & `cumulus_bond` providers to manage your network interfaces. Used alone it will over-write any existing configuration in the `/etc/network/interfaces` file.

### Definitions
----
#### cumulus_interface_policy

Manage the interface configuration snippets. The provided list of interfaces is compared to the contents of the configuration directory. Any configuration files which exist on disk but are not in the list of interfaces are deleted. This allows you to ensure that no unmanaged interface configurations are installed.

Note that this includes interfaces such as `eth0` and `lo`, so these interfaces must be included in the `allowed` list or strange things may happen.

##### Parameters:

* `name` - Name for the resource. This is not directly used by the provider.
* `allowed` - Array of interface names that you are managing with Chef. Any configurations that are not listed will be deleted.
* `location` - Location of the configuration snippets directory. Default is the directory set by the `node['cumulus']['interfaces']['dir']` attribute.

##### Examples:

Manage `eth0`, `lo`, `swp1` though `swp32`, `bond0` through `bond25` and `br0`:

````ruby
cumulus_interface_policy 'policy' do
  allowed ['eth0', 'lo', 'swp1-32', 'bond0-25', 'br0']
  notifies :reload, "service[networking]"
end
````

#### cumulus_interface

Manage a network interface using the ifupdown2 `ifquery` tool. The configuration for the interface will be written to a fragment under the interface configurations fragments directory.

The cumulus_interface provider can be used to manage front panel ports, L3 bridge sub-interfaces, L3 physical or bond sub-interfaces, L2/L3 trunks and access ports, the loopback and management ports. For bridge or bond interfaces, see cumulus_bridge or cumulus_bond, below.

##### Parameters:

* `name` - Identifier for the interface.
* `ipv4` - Array of IPv4 addresses to be applied to the interface.
* `ipv6` - Array of IPv6 addresses to be applied to the interface.
* `alias_name` - Interface alias.
* `addr_method` - Address assignment method, `dhcp` or `loopback`. Default is empty, I.e. no address method is set.
* `speed` - The interface link speed.
* `mtu` - The interface Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
* `virtual_ip` - VRR virtual IP
* `virtual_mac` - VRR virtual MAC
* `vids` - Array of VLANs to be configured for a VLAN aware trunk interface.
* `pvid` - Native VLAN for a VLAN aware trunk interface.
* `post_up` - String or Array of post-up commands(s) to run.
* `pre_down` - String or Array of pre-down commands(s) to run.
* `location` - Location of the configuration snippets directory. Default is the directory set by the `node['cumulus']['interfaces']['dir']` attribute.
* `mstpctl_portnetwork` - Enable bridge assurance on a VLAN aware trunk.
* `mstpctl_bpduguard` - Enable BPDU guard on a VLAN aware trunk.
* `mstpctl_portadminedge` - Enables admin edge port.

The following CLAG related attributes are also available. If CLAG is enabled, `clagd_enable`, `clagd_priority`, `clagd_peer_id` and `clagd_sys_mac` should all be provided:

* `clagd_enable` - Enable the clagd daemon.
* `clagd_priority` - Set the CLAG priority for this switch.
* `clagd_peer_id` - Address of the CLAG peer switch.
* `clagd_sys_mac` - CLAG system MAC. The MAC must be identical on both of the CLAG peers.
* `clagd_args` - Any additional arguments to be passed to the clagd deamon.

##### Examples:

Configure the loopback interface and the management interface `eth0` using DHCP:

````ruby
cumulus_interface 'lo' do
  addr_method 'loopback'
end

cumulus_interface 'eth0' do
  addr_method 'dhcp'
end
````

Configure `swp33` as a 1GbE port with a single IPv4 address:

````ruby
cumulus_interface 'swp33' do
  ipv4 ['10.30.1.1/24']
  link_speed 1000
end
````

Configure the interface `peerlink.4094` as the CLAG peer interface:

````ruby
cumulus_interface 'peerlink.4094' do
  ipv4 ['10.100.1.0/31']
  clagd_enable true
  clagd_peer_ip '10.100.1.1/31'
  clagd_sys_mac '11:11:22:22:33:33'
end
````

#### cumulus_bond

Manage a network bond using the ifupdown2 `ifquery` tool. The configuration for the interface will be written to a fragment under the interface configurations fragments directory.

##### Parameters:

* `name` - Identifier for the bond interface.
* `slaves` - Bond members.
* `min_links` - Minimum number of slave links for the bond to be considered up. Default is `1`.
* `mode` - Bond mode. Default is `802.3ad`
* `miimon` - MII link monitoring interval. Default is `100`
* `xmit_hash_policy` - TX hashing policy. Default is `layer3+4`
* `lacp_rate` - LACP bond rate. Default is `1` I.e. fast LACP timeout.
* `ipv4` - Array of IPv4 addresses to be applied to the interface.
* `ipv6` - Array of IPv6 addresses to be applied to the interface.
